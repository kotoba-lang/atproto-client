  "Reference JVM `IHttp` for `kotoba.lang.atproto-client.atproto/IHttp`,
  backed by the JDK's built-in `java.net.http.HttpClient` (Java 11+).

  Zero extra runtime deps: `java.net.http` ships with the JDK, so this
  reference adapter can live directly in this repo's own `src/`
  (`:paths [\"src\"]`) without pulling `babashka.http-client` (or any other
  HTTP client) into the core library's dependency footprint. That keeps
  `IHttp` from being 'just an abstract protocol with no usable
  implementation anywhere in the repo' -- this namespace, plus the
  `jdk-http`-driven tests in `test/kotoba/lang/atproto_client/pds_test.clj`,
  are a real, working consumer. (This repo's test suite separately also
  proves the design against a second, real backend --
  `babashka.http-client`, wired in as a `:test`-alias-only dep -- see the
  same test file's `babashka-http`.)

  Not the only option: any host already depending on
  `babashka.http-client`, another JVM HTTP client, or (in CLJS) browser
  `fetch`, is free to `(reify atproto/IHttp ...)` directly against the same
  `-request` seam; this is offered as the batteries-included default for
  plain JVM/Clojure callers, not a requirement.

  Plain `.clj` (not `.cljc`): `java.net.http` is JVM-only. A CLJS host
  would implement the same `IHttp` with `js/fetch` instead (see this
  package's README)."

  `:timeout-ms` is this retrofit's replacement for the pre-retrofit `xrpc`'s
  per-call `:timeout` option (forwarded straight to babashka.http-client):
  a socket/read timeout is a transport-level concern with no meaningful,
  uniform expression across `java.net.http` / `babashka.http-client` /
  browser `fetch` (AbortController) / a test fake, so `xrpc`'s pure core no
